Created small project management service

Ideology as below
Admin will be super user to manage entire system controls
Business developer  will handle all projects
Project Manager will handle all project updates
User/developer will can read complete info (only read access)

PS: i can extend the current implementation based on suggestion .. in interest of time implemented all basic functionalities

Admin - Super user
Can create/update/delete project
Can create/update/delete user
Can create/update/delete project management

Business developer
Can create/update/delete project
Can create/update/delete project management

Project Manager
Can update project
Can update management

User
All read access (GET API calls)

Login

For now login API exist without any special validation on user info like password (will implement JWT,OAUTH on demand)
once user login his role would be stored in thread locale

based on role of user API access would be restricted
